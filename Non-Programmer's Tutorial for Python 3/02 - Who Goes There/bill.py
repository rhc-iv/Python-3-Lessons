# Variables store data. The variables in the above program are a, b23, first_name, b, and c. The two basic types are strings and numbers. Strings are a sequence of letters, numbers and other characters. In this example b23 and first_name are variables that are storing strings. Spam, Bill, a + b is, first_name is, and Sorted Parts, After Midnight or are the strings in this program. The characters are surrounded by " or '. The other type of variables are numbers. Remember that variables are used to store a value, they do not use quotation marks (" and '). If you want to use an actual value, you must use quotation marks.
