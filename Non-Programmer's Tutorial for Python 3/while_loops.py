# FIRST, set the initial value of the variable a to 0(zero).
a = 0

# While the value of the variable a is less than 10 do the following:
while a < 10:

# Increase the value of the variable a by 1, as in: a = a + 1!
    a = a + 1

# Print to screen what the present value of the variable a is.
    print(a)     

# REPEAT! until the value of the variable a is equal to 9!? See note. 

# NOTE:
# The value of the variable a will increase by 1
# with each repeat, or loop of the 'while statement BLOCK'.
# e.g. a = 1 then a = 2 then a = 3 etc. until a = 9 then...
# the code will finish adding 1 to a (now a = 10), printing the 
# result, and then exiting the 'while statement BLOCK'.
