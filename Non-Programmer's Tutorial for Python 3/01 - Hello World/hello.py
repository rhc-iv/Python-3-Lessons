#!/usr/bin/env python3

# If you are using the command line to run programs then type it in with a text editor, save it as hello.py and run it with python3 hello.py

# What we are doing is using a function called print. The function's name - print - is followed by parentheses containing zero or more arguments. In this example, there is one argument, which is "Hello, World!". Note that this argument is a group of characters enclosed in double quotes (""). This is commonly referred to as a string of characters, or string, for short. Another example of a string is "Jack and Jill went up a hill". The combination of a function and parentheses with the arguments is a function call. A function and its arguments are one type of statement that python has.
