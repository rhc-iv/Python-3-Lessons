# Note that the previous example ('example_1.py') could have been
# written in an even shorter form, like so:

for count in range(1, 11):
    print(count)

# The range function returns an iterable. This can be converted into 
# a list with the list function. which will then be the dominant number.

# The next line for count in one_to_ten: uses the for control structure. 
# A for control structure looks like for variable in list:. list is gone 
# through starting with the first element of the list and going to the last. 
# As for goes through each element in a list it puts each into variable. 
# That allows variable to be used in each successive time the for loop is 
# run through.
